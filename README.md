# KTP Detection

Flutter AEJ Bootcamp MLKit Text Recognition

## Getting Started

This project is to knowing how to build a Flutter App with ML Kit Text Recognition Feature, our references are based on this [article](https://medium.com/tlabcircle/mendeteksi-data-ktp-menggunakan-ml-kit-text-recognition-da16e414af1e), but that article is outdated because some of the packages are discontinued. So in this project are enhancement from that article, we use Camera as a camera, google_mlkit_text_recognition as an OCR, and riverpod as a state management.

You can see the `pubspec.yaml` for all the packages that we use in this Project

This project doesn't have a lot of features, bcs this project is experimental how to use MLKit on KTP (Kartu Tanda Penduduk)
